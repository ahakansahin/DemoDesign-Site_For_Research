# [Research Website](https://siteforresearch.netlify.app/)
- This site is designed to provide sample template for customers.
- The codes of this site are written with html, css, javascript and OpenCage data. The project includes Font Awesome and Bootstrap libraries.
- The codes belong to me and are free to use.
- Since the codes are not generated by prioritizing clean code, you can contact me for the parts that you have difficulty in understanding.
